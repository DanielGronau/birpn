#summary Extending BIRPN with your own functions

= Writing Functions =

While the basic class for an operation is Op, most of the operations in BIRPN are actually functions, which means that they remove their operands from the stack and put *one* `BigInteger` back to the stack. In this case you should use one of the function classes as your base class.

Consider you want to write a function for the least common denominator. You can calculate it by the formula lcd(a,b) = a*b/gcd(a,b). It needs two arguments, so you can extend Function2. Note that you get the arguments in reverse order, so `args[0]` is the last argument, `args[1]` is the second to last one etc. 

You must just provide the calc- and the toString-Method. Here is a possible implementation:

{{{
package mypackage;

//Some classes moved in the current sources,
//so in BIRPN0.2.jar, you must use import org.birpn.ops.Function2; instead
import org.birpn.Function2; 
import java.math.BigInteger;

public class Lcd extends Function2 {

    @Override
    public BigInteger calc(BigInteger... args) {
        return args[1].multiply(args[0]).divide(args[1].gcd(args[0]));
    }

    @Override public String toString() {
        return "lcd";
    }
}
}}}
