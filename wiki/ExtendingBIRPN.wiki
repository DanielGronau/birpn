#summary Extending BIRPN with your own functions

= Writing Functions =

While the basic class for an operation is Op, most of the operations in BIRPN are actually functions, which means that they remove their operands from the stack and put *one* `BigInteger` back to the stack. In this case you should use one of the function classes as your base class.

Consider you want to write a function for the least common denominator. You can calculate it by the formula lcd(a,b) = a*b/gcd(a,b). It needs two arguments, so you can extend Function2.
You must just provide the calc- and the toString-Method. Here is a possible implementation:

{{{
package mypackage;

//This works for the SVN trunk, but is not compatible to BIRPN-0.2.jar
import org.birpn.Function2; 
import java.math.BigInteger;

public class Lcd extends Function2 {

    @Override
    public BigInteger calc(BigInteger x, BigInteger y) {
        return x.multiply(y).divide(x.gcd(y));
    }

    @Override public String toString() {
        return "lcd";
    }
}
}}}
