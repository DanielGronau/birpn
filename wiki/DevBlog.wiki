Okay, the scope of this project is quite limited, but I'm working on the next release. I'll add some JUnit tests and maybe some useful functions. The biggest improvement will be, that I make BIRPN "pluggable", which means that you can add your own functions at runtime. 

Today I had the idea to support boolean operations by having a TRUE and FALSE constant, and it seems to work quite well. I included a boolean evaluation function is(...), and a function results(...) which exposes the stack content (if you want to calculate several values at once, like BigInteger.divideAndRemainder does, or for debugging)
